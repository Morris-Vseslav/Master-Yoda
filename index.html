                    <h2>Master Yoda</h2>
<p>&mdash; Biography
  Early life and the High Republic Era
  "For 800 years have I trained Jedi."<strong style="margin-left: 0.0625em;">*</strong> â€•Yoda, to Luke Skywalker
  Born 900 years before the Battle of Endor, Yoda belonged to an ancient and mysterious species and never revealed his homeworld. As he was keenly attuned to the Force, he joined the Jedi Order as a youngling. After undergoing the ritual known as the Gathering, he received his cyber crystal, and Professor Huyang helped him construct his first lightsaber aboard the Crucible. At some point during his time as a youngling, Yoda skipped across the lily pads in the Jedi Temple's meditation pond. Yoda was paired up with a personal mentor. During their time together, Yoda's Jedi Master told him the tale of K'ungfu and Chuang, two great Jedi of the past. Around the age of 100, Yoda was ready to pass on what he had learned. Having attained the rank of Master, he spent the next eight centuries training and tutoring generations of Jedi. It was estimated that over his lifetime, he trained around 20,000 Jedi.
  
  Yoda is a fictional character in the Star Wars universe, first appearing in the 1980 film The Empire Strikes Back. He is a small, green humanoid alien who is powerful with the Force and served as Grandmaster of the Jedi Order. In The Empire Strikes Back, Yoda was voiced and puppeteered by Frank Oz, who reprised the role in Return of the Jedi, the prequel trilogy, and the sequel trilogy. Outside of the films, the character has been mainly voiced by Tom Kane, starting with the 2003 Clone Wars animated television series. Yoda has since become an iconic figure in popular culture due to his distinct pattern of speech and role as a wise mentor.</p>
<p style="opacity: 1;"><strong style="margin-right: 0.0625em;">*</strong>In his first appearance in the original trilogy, Yoda is described as the mentor of Obi-Wan Kenobi and lives in exile on the swamp planet of Dagobah. He trains Luke Skywalker in the ways of the Force until his death at the age of 900 in Return of the Jedi, though he later returns as a Force spirit. In the prequel trilogy, Yoda leads the Jedi High Council and trains the young generations of Jedi until they are assigned to a master. When the Clone Wars breaks out, he becomes a general in the Galactic Republic's army and leads several legions of clone troopers. Yoda is one of the few Jedi to survive the events of Order 66 at the end of the war, and faces off against Emperor Palpatine, but is outmatched and forced to go into hiding. Yoda's spirit appears again in the sequel trilogy, advising an older Luke and empowering Rey to face a revived Palpatine.</p>
